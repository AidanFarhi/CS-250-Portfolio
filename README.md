- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Intepreting user needs can be done several in a few simple steps. First, I would set up a face-to-face meeting.
During this time I would ask focused questions to obtain high-level requirements.
Next, I would send out a document outlined all of the gathered requirements and ask for feedback.
Once, feedback was recieved and a final list of requirements is agreed upon, I would break up the work into tasks. User stories are one approach to documenting and managing tasks. 
My aproach would by to break up the project into smaller units of work,
and utilize GitHub Projects to organize all of them. I would work on the tasks that were highest priority based on due date or logical dependency.
For example, if there is a task to create the database tables, first the datbase infrastructure task must be comleted.
Continuing in this way, I would complete the project.

- How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
