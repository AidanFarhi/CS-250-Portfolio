- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Intepreting user needs can be done several in a few simple steps. First, I would set up a face-to-face meeting.
During this time I would ask focused questions to obtain high-level requirements.
Next, I would send out a document outlining all of the gathered requirements circulate for feedback.
Once, feedback was recieved and a final list of requirements is agreed upon, I would break up the work into tasks. User stories are one approach to documenting and managing tasks. 
My aproach would by to break up the project into smaller units of work,
and utilize GitHub Projects to organize all of them. I would work on the tasks that were highest priority based on due date or logical dependency.
For example, if there is a task to create the database tables, first the datbase infrastructure task must be comleted.
Continuing in this way, I would complete the project.

- How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My approach to developing programs is simple. Build out the highest priorty units first. If feedback, clarity, or help is needed, reach out.
I can't think of any Agile processes that I would incorporate in my own personal program development.
When I am on a team that utilizes some sort of Agile framework, I adopt it.

- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team mate is an effective communicator. They will volunteer to help whenever another team member is struggling.
Whenever a challenge is presented, they are willing and able to take it on. Adaptability and acceptance of frequent change
are core values.
